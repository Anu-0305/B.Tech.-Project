**3D Visualization of a System of Linear Equations**

Project Overview

This project is a 3D visualization tool for solving and graphing a system of three linear equations with three variables (x, y, and z). 
It demonstrates how these equations can be represented as planes in a three-dimensional space and finds their point of intersection, which represents the unique solution to the system.
