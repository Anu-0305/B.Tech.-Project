# B.Tech.-Project
This repository contains projects done by me (Anushka) in different semesters


1. Python projects

1.1 **3D Visualization of a System of Linear Equations** (sem 2- Mar,2024)

    Project Overview
    
    This project is a 3D visualization tool for solving and graphing a system of three linear equations with three variables (x, y, and z). 
    It demonstrates how these equations can be represented as planes in a three-dimensional space and finds their point of intersection, which represents the unique solution to the system.

2. Data Structure Projects 
2.1 **TRAIN COMPARTMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**
   Concepts Used:--
   Programming language - C
    Linked List (Each train compartment is a node)
    Dynamic Memory Allocation (malloc() and free())
    Pointers and Structures (struct Compartment)
    Menu-driven Interface (switch case)

This project is a Train Compartment Management System that simulates how train compartments can be added, removed, swapped, and displayed using a linked list. Each compartment is represented as a node in a linked list, where compartments are connected in sequence like a real train.

The project provides a menu-driven interface that allows the user to perform various operations on the train compartments dynamically.
